    "## b| Calculations for CRBN-dependency interpretation in `python`\n",
    "The calculations for CRBN-dependency prediction are done in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, features are selected for each treatment (\"treatment-centric\"). These features exhibit high heterogeniety in RKO WT, but exhibit a clear morphological perturbation in RKO CRBN OE. The morphological perturbation in question tends to be higher in RKO CRBN OE than RKO CRBN KO.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesize that these treatment-centric features could be used to calculate an **induction score** (loosely inspired by the approaches described by [Schneidewind _et al._](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2021.06.003) and [Woehrmann _et al._](https://doi.org/10.1039/C3MB70245F)). The induction score should reflect the overall change in treatment-centric features per image (per treatment and per cell line). The induction score should be the highest in RKO CRBN OE and the lowest in RKO CRBN KO. The difference between these two cell lines can be quantified using the U statistic from the Mann-Whitney U test. (I use the **corrected U** statistic instead, which is the U statistic as a fraction of the maximum possible U statistic for a given treatment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the way features are selected with the treatment-centric strategy, CRBN-independent treatments could exhibit the same induction vaue trend. I would, however, expect the trend to be a lot weaker/less pronounced compared to CRBN-dependent treatments."
