# Isogenic CPA
A computational framework developed for using general cell morphological features for predicting and characterizing multi-specific drugs. The computational framework was developed by Amanda Ng and used in "REFERENCE PLACEHOLDER" for studying compounds that degrade proteins by co-opting the E3 ligase Cereblon (CRBN).
